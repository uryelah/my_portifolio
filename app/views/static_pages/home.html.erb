    <p>Howdy!ðŸŒ»</p>
    <p>
        I'm Sarah, and Iâ€™m a certified Ruby on Rails and React full-stack web developer with a experience in UX research and design.
    </p>
    <p>
        Iâ€™m currently completing a degree in Computer Science and am exploring front-end remote opportunities with digital-product teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, Iâ€™m a Technical Support Engineer and mentor at Microverse, a remote full-stack development school, and a freelance as a front-end developer, working with a small collective of developers building solutions for medium-sized businesses using ReactJS and Firebase. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I especially enjoy building cohesive systems that are as functional as they are visually pleasing.
